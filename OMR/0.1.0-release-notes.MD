Basics:
1. Release date: July 12th, 2018 (If we get everything done by July 4th, review will conclude on July 11th. I added a day after the review ends just in case.)

2. Release Name: 0.1.0

3. Description:

This will be the **initial release** of the Eclipse OMR project. 

The Eclipse OMR project is a set of open source C and C++ components that can be used to build robust language runtimes that support many different hardware and operating system platforms.

For this initial release, all of the components are functionally stable, but a few of them have not finalized an API yet. The list of components with stable APIs will grow with future releases. The table below summarizes the current status:

Component     | Description            | Functionality          |&nbsp; API &nbsp; |
:-------------| :----------------------|:---------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------: |
port          | A platform porting library | :white_check_mark:    | :white_check_mark: |
thread        | A cross platform pthread-like threading library | :white_check_mark:    | :white_check_mark: |
util          | General utilities useful for building cross platform runtimes | :white_check_mark:    | :white_check_mark: | 
compiler      | Components for building compiler technology, such as JIT compilers | :white_check_mark:    | 
diagnostics   | A diagnostic tooling library | :white_check_mark:    |  |
gc            | Garbage collection framework for managed heaps | :white_check_mark:    |  |
jitbuilder    | A simple high-level abstraction on top of the compiler technology | :white_check_mark:    |  |
vm            | APIs to manage per-interpreter and per-thread contexts | :white_check_mark:    | |

     1. Name, Date and Description for each milestone
4. Internationalization
5. Target Environments
     List OS / compilers versions tested on in the CI.  I am not sure how to format the list.
